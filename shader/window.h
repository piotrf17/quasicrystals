// Some basic window classes that simplify creating an application with an
// OpenGL window.  These classes setup reasonable defaults, and simply leave
// a few functions to be overridden:
//   Init(): called before entering the main application loop.
//   Resize(): called after a resize event (easiest to use defaults)
//   Keypress(): called whenever a key is _pressed_ (not released)
//   Draw(): called after handling all events
// 
// The classes provided in this file are:
// Window - A bare bones abstract class that handles an event loop.
// Window2d - Sets up an orthographic projection with pixel coordinates
//   in the rectangle (0, 0) - (width, height)
//
// To use, inherit from one of these classes, and implement any missing virtual
// functions.  Then, simply create your window and call run:
// MyWindow window(800, 600, "A program");
// window.Run();
